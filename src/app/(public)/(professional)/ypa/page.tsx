				What Is YPA?
			</h2>
			<p className="mt-4 max-w-7xl">
				Dublin City Schoolsâ€™ Young Professionals Academy (YPA) is a program
				committed to providing work- based learning opportunities for high
				school juniors and seniors. Work-based learning (WBL) is a coordinated
				sequence of experiences designed to provide students with real-world
				learning through partnerships with local business and industry
				professionals. These learning activities help students explore careers
				and choose an appropriate career path. Research has shown that WBL helps
				business by providing positive promotion for your company in the
				community, long-term workforce development, and exceptional employee
				productivity. Businesses also have discovered, recruited, and eventually
				hired employees through WBL internships.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4 max-w-7xl">
				Students participating in our program have applied, had their grades and
				attendance records reviewed, and came with several recommendations prior
				to their acceptance. These highly motivated and capable young men and
				women need internship mentors in order to help continue to develop their
				future-ready-skills through work-based learning opportunities.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4 max-w-7xl">
				While enrolled in YPA, students are instructed in career research and
				preparation, communication skills, problem solving, teamwork, and the
				soft skills many companies are seeking in their employees. Students
				develop cover letters, resumes, and other resources to market themselves
				and their skills. Students are placed at worksites and businesses based
				upon their career interests and aptitudes. Throughout this educational
				partnership, students experience a plethora of job activities in various
				departments, often interacting with several different employees or
				working solely with one individual. Each student is required to complete
				research, observations, interviews, and participate in projects and
				tasks while at each internship in coordination with their mentor(s)
				needs and schedules. Our work-based learning experiences involve the
				following:
			</p>
			<ul className="mt-4 ml-4 max-w-6xl list-disc space-y-2">
				<li>
					Six-week educational mentorship experiences in either in the fall or
					the spring semesters of the school year
				</li>
				<li>
					Student will present mentor(s) with an agency mentorship agreement,
					emergency forms, resumes, and informational forms prior to starting
					their educational partnership
				</li>
				<li>
					Student and mentor(s) discuss learning goals and expectations during
					initial interviews/meetings
				</li>
				<li>
					Mentor(s) and students develop a schedule of three to four time
					periods per week for a minimum of six hours per week for a total of 35
					to 36 hours per six-week internship. There is flexibility as the
					quality of the partnership is more important than just achieving a
					total number of hours
				</li>
				<li>Mentors are asked to sign off on student time logs each week</li>
				<li>
					Mentors share individual and company expectations and opportunities
					with the student throughout the internship
				</li>
				<li>
					Mentors are asked to perform or coordinate a short, mock interview for
					the student during the internship
				</li>
				<li>
					Our YPA mentorships are educational learning opportunities; therefore,
					students are not considered employees in respect to worker&rsquo;s
					compensation or other fair labor laws as they are earning academic
					credits during this work-based learning experience
				</li>
			</ul>
